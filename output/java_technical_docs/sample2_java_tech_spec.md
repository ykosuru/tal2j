# Java Technical Specifications: InventorySystem

## 1. Class Description

The `InventorySystem` class is a Java application designed to manage a basic inventory of items via a text-based console interface. It replicates the functionality of the original TAL `inventory_system` module. It presents a menu to the user, allowing them to perform operations such as adding, deleting, updating, and querying inventory items, as well as generating reports. The class utilizes static variables to store inventory data, error status, and configuration constants, mimicking the global scope of the TAL variables. It demonstrates the use of arrays, custom classes (representing structures), static methods (representing subprocedures), external method calls, and basic error handling within a Java context.

## 2. Input Parameters

The main entry point (`public static void main(String[] args)`) accepts standard command-line arguments (`String[] args`), but these are not used by the core application logic. The program relies on the following inputs during execution:

*   **User Command Input:** An integer value entered by the user via the standard input stream (`System.in`) in response to the menu prompt. This input is read by the (placeholder) `readCommand` static method, typically using a `java.util.Scanner`, and stored in the local variable `cmd` within the `main` method. Valid inputs are expected to be integers from 1 to 6.
*   **Data for Operations (Implied):** Although the core logic for add, delete, update, and query is currently implemented as placeholders, a fully functional version would require additional user input (e.g., item ID, name, price) specific to each operation, also read via `System.in`.

## 3. Return Value

The `main` method is `void`. Program termination status is indicated using `System.exit(int statusCode)`:

*   **`SUCCESS` (0):** Indicates normal program termination without unhandled errors encountered during the main processing loop or cleanup. Achieved via `System.exit(SUCCESS)`.

*Note: While error conditions are detected and reported via `printError`, the current logic only explicitly terminates with `SUCCESS` (0) from the `main` method's normal flow. Unhandled exceptions or explicit calls to `System.exit` with non-zero codes could indicate errors.*

## 4. Core Logic/Processing Steps

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Static fields are initialized (either at declaration or in a static initializer block):
        *   The static `StringBuilder buffer` is allocated with a capacity of `BUFFER_SIZE` (e.g., 4096 characters).
        *   The `initializeInventory` static method is called to populate the static `inventory` array (an array of `ItemRecord` objects) with predefined sample item records and set the `inventoryCount`.
    *   The local command variable `cmd` within `main` is initialized to 0.

2.  **Main Processing Loop:**
    *   The program enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `cmd` is not equal to 6 (the EXIT command).
    *   **Display Menu:** The `displayMenu` static method is called to print the available command options (1-6) and their descriptions (fetched from `COMMAND_CODES` and `COMMAND_NAMES` arrays) to the standard output stream (`System.out`) using the static `buffer`.
    *   **Read Command:** The `readCommand` static method (placeholder) is called to obtain the user's menu choice (an integer), which is stored in the `cmd` variable. Input validation (e.g., handling non-integer input) should be implemented within `readCommand`.
    *   **Command Dispatch (`switch` Statement):**
        *   A `switch` statement evaluates `cmd`:
            *   Cases 1-5: The corresponding placeholder static method (`addItem`, `deleteItem`, `updateItem`, `queryItem`, `generateReport`) is called. These currently only print a "not implemented" message to `System.out`.
            *   Case 6: The `switch` statement does nothing specific for this case. The `while` loop condition will subsequently become false, causing the loop to terminate.
            *   `default` (Handles invalid numeric commands): The static `errorCode` is set to `ERROR_INVALID_INPUT`, and the `printError` static method is called to display the corresponding error message from the `ERROR_MESSAGES` array.
    *   **Transaction Logging:** If the command was valid and not 6 (EXIT), the static `transactionCount` is incremented, and the static method `ExternalLogger.logTransaction` (simulating an external call) is invoked, passing the command code (`cmd`) and the updated transaction count.

3.  **Cleanup and Termination:**
    *   After the `while` loop terminates (user entered 6):
        *   The program checks if the static `errorCode` is non-zero. If it is, `printError` is called again (this might be redundant if the error was already printed within the loop).
        *   An example bit manipulation sequence is performed: If `inventoryCount` > 0, it sets the `isActive` and `taxExempt` bits (represented as integer flags or boolean fields) within a `CustomerRecord` object referenced by the static `currentCustomer` variable. *Note: The logic assumes `currentCustomer` references a valid, initialized `CustomerRecord` object, which is not explicitly established in the provided flow.*
        *   The program terminates normally by calling `System.exit(SUCCESS)`.

## 5. Dependencies

*   **Internal Static Methods Called:**
    *   `initializeInventory`: Populates initial inventory data.
    *   `displayMenu`: Shows the user menu.
    *   `readCommand` (Placeholder): Reads user command input from `System.in`.
    *   `printError`: Displays error messages based on `errorCode`.
    *   `addItem` (Placeholder): Stub for adding items.
    *   `deleteItem` (Placeholder): Stub for deleting items.

    *   `transactionCount` (int): Tracks the number of processed commands.
    *   `inventory` (`ItemRecord[]`): Array holding the inventory data objects.
    *   `inventoryCount` (int): Current number of items in the `inventory` array.
    *   `currentCustomer` (`CustomerRecord`): Reference used in the example bit manipulation section. Needs proper initialization.
    *   `buffer` (`StringBuilder`): General-purpose buffer for string formatting and console I/O.
    *   `COMMAND_CODES` (int[]): Numeric codes for menu commands.
    *   `COMMAND_NAMES` (String[]): Text names for menu commands.
    *   `ItemRecord` (class): Defines the structure for an inventory item (fields like `itemId`, `name`, `price`, `quantity`).
    *   `CustomerRecord` (class): Defines the structure for a customer record (used in bit manipulation example, fields like `customerId`, `statusFlags` or booleans like `isActive`, `taxExempt`).
    *   Constants (`MAX_ITEMS`, `MAX_CUSTOMERS`, `BUFFER_SIZE`, `SUCCESS`, error codes): Defined as `private static final int` or `String`.

*   **Standard Java Libraries:**
    *   `java.lang.System` (for `in`, `out`, `exit`)
    *   `java.util.Scanner` (for reading user input)
    *   `java.lang.StringBuilder` (for efficient string manipulation)
    *   `java.lang.String`
    *   Arrays (`[]`)

## 6. Usage Examples or Edge Cases

*   **Typical Usage:**
    1.  The application starts, running the `main` method. The menu is displayed on the console.
    2.  User enters `1` (ADD) and presses Enter. The program prints "Add item functionality not yet implemented." and calls `ExternalLogger.logTransaction`.
    3.  The menu is displayed again.
    4.  User enters `4` (QUERY) and presses Enter. The program prints "Query item functionality not yet implemented." and calls `ExternalLogger.logTransaction`.
    5.  The menu is displayed again.
    6.  User enters `6` (EXIT) and presses Enter. The program performs final checks (like the `errorCode` check and bit manipulation example) and terminates normally via `System.exit(0)`.

*   **Edge Cases & Limitations (Java Context):**
    *   **Invalid Command Input:**
        *   Entering non-numeric text when an integer is expected: The `Scanner.nextInt()` method (if used in `readCommand`) will throw an `InputMismatchException` if not handled, potentially crashing the program unless caught.
        *   Entering a number outside the 1-6 range: Handled by the `default` case in the `switch` statement, setting `errorCode` and calling `printError`.
    *   **Placeholder Functionality:** Core inventory operations (add, delete, update, query, report) are not implemented. Calls to these methods currently do nothing useful.
    *   **I/O Implementation:** The `readCommand`, `writeLine`, and `write` methods are placeholders. A robust implementation requires proper use of `Scanner` (or other input methods) and `System.out.println`/`print`. Error handling for I/O operations might be needed.
    *   **Inventory Limits:** The `inventory` array has a fixed size (`MAX_ITEMS`). The placeholder `addItem` does not check for array bounds, potentially leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if more items are added than the array capacity allows. Using `java.util.ArrayList<ItemRecord>` could provide dynamic resizing.
    *   **Error Handling:** Error handling relies on setting an `errorCode` and printing messages. This is procedural; a more idiomatic Java approach might involve custom exceptions for specific error conditions (e.g., `InvalidCommandException`, `InventoryFullException`). The final check of `errorCode` before exiting might be redundant.
    *   **External Dependencies:** The program relies on the `ExternalLogger` class and its `logTransaction` method being available in the classpath and functioning correctly.
    *   **Buffer Usage:** Using a single static `StringBuilder` (`buffer`) is generally safe for sequential operations but would require synchronization if the application were multi-threaded. Its capacity (`BUFFER_SIZE`) should be sufficient for the largest expected string.
    *   **Object Initialization:** The `currentCustomer` static variable must be initialized to a valid `CustomerRecord` object before the bit manipulation example is executed; otherwise, a `NullPointerException` will occur. The current flow doesn't show this initialization.
    *   **Static State:** Relying heavily on static fields for application state makes the class difficult to instance multiple times and harder to test. It's suitable for a simple, single-instance command-line tool but less flexible for larger applications or concurrent environments.
