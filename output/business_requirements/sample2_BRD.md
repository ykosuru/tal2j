Business Requirements Document

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the preliminary business requirements derived from the technical specifications of the legacy TAL program `inventory_system`. The inferred purpose of this program was to provide a basic, interactive capability for managing a list of inventory items, likely for a user operating in a text-based terminal environment.

**2. Business Problem/Opportunity**

Based on the program's functionality (add, delete, update, query items, generate reports via a simple menu), the likely business problem it addressed was the need for a rudimentary, computerized method to track inventory items, replacing potentially manual (paper-based) or less formalized tracking systems. This offered an opportunity to centralize basic inventory data, provide quick lookups, updates, and reporting, and introduce a minimal level of operational logging within its specific environment. The system provided a simple, command-driven interface for direct user interaction with inventory data.

**3. Proposed Solution Overview (Modernization Context)**

A modernized version of this functionality would likely take the form of a backend service or microservice. This service would expose APIs (e.g., RESTful endpoints) to perform the core inventory management functions (Create, Read, Update, Delete - CRUD) and reporting. The text-based menu interface would be replaced by API calls, allowing integration with various modern front-ends (web UIs, mobile apps) or other backend systems. Data persistence would be handled by a database instead of in-memory structures. Transaction logging would integrate with modern logging frameworks or services.

**4. Key Functional Requirements**

The following functional requirements are derived from the TAL specifications:

*   The system must provide functionality to manage inventory items.
*   The system must support the following core operations on inventory items:
    *   Add a new item.
    *   Delete an existing item.
    *   Update an existing item.
    *   Query/retrieve details of an existing item.
*   The system must be able to generate an inventory report (specific content to be defined, but the capability is required).
*   The system must accept input parameters necessary to perform the requested operation (e.g., item details for adding/updating, item identifier for deleting/querying).
*   The system must provide a mechanism to initiate these operations (analogous to the original menu commands 1-5).
*   The system must provide a mechanism to terminate or exit the main processing flow (analogous to the original menu command 6).
*   The system must handle invalid requests or inputs (analogous to the original `OTHERWISE` case for invalid command numbers).
*   The system must log each successful core inventory operation (Add, Delete, Update, Query, Report) performed. This logging should interface with an external logging mechanism/system.
*   The system must track the number of transactions logged.
*   The system must manage a defined set of data attributes for each inventory item (based on the `item_record` structure, likely including fields like item ID, name, quantity, price - *specific fields need confirmation*).
*   The system must be able to initialize its inventory data (analogous to `initialize_inventory`, potentially loading from a persistent source in a modern context).
*   The system must return a status indicating the overall success or failure upon completion of its main task or session (analogous to the original `success` return code).
*   The system must manage and report internal error conditions (analogous to setting `error_code` and calling `print_error`).

**5. Non-Functional Requirements (Optional/Inferred)**

The following non-functional aspects are inferred or represent areas needing definition based on the original system's characteristics:

*   **Data Persistence:** The original system appeared to use in-memory structures (`inventory` array) potentially re-initialized on each run. *Assumption:* A modern system must persist inventory data reliably between sessions (e.g., using a database).
*   **Data Capacity:** The original system had a fixed limit (`max_items`). *Assumption:* The capacity requirements (number of items, expected growth) for a modern system need to be defined. Scalability should be considered.
*   **Error Handling:** The original system had basic error code reporting. *Assumption:* A modern system will require more robust and descriptive error handling mechanisms suitable for API integration.
*   **Integration:** The system requires integration with an external transaction logging facility.
*   **User Interface:** The original system used a text-based menu. A modern system decouples the core logic (service/API) from the UI, which needs to be specified separately if required.
*   **Performance:** No performance metrics are mentioned in the specs. *Assumption:* Basic interactive performance was likely sufficient. Performance requirements (e.g., API response times, report generation time) need to be defined for a modern system.
*   **Security:** Not mentioned in the specs. *Assumption:* Security (authentication, authorization, data protection) is a critical requirement for any modern system and needs to be defined.
